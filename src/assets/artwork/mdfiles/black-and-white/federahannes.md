<hr>
<p>Celebrating carnival ("Fasnet") with the local traditional costumes in my hometown Rottweil.</p>
<p>The "Federahannes" with his spring pole, tusks protruding from his mouth and wide coat embodies the devil and is therefore one of the oldest carnival masks of all. It could have been created before 1700. The rolled chin dates from the Baroque period. The goose feathers attached to his dress give Federahannes his name.
Today, he is probably the best known of the <a href="https://www.rottweil.de/de/Stadt-Buerger/Unsere-Stadt/Rottweiler-Fasnet/Narrentypen" style="text-transform: none">Rottweiler carnival types</a>.</p>
