# Deploy app to GitHub Pages

* Work on branch "main"
* If app is buildable, run
`npm run deploy`
* app will be build and pushed to branch "deployment"
* Now some manual effort (cause GitHub) does not preserve the different domain:
  * Go to the [settings](https://github.com/vereba/vereba.github.io/settings/pages)
  * Enter the domain adress under "Custom domain"


*A more detailed description can be found
